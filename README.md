# SENIOR-PROJECT

This project develops a new way to analyze defensive matchups in a more subjective way. Although we are in an analytic field where concrete details base our analyses, we analyze humans and their performance, so introducing a subjective lens is necessary. Our goal is to build a system in which we can fairly apply weights to situations based on players’ efficiencies in different aspects of the game. Working as a part-timer at ProFootballFocus (PFF) introduced me to the processes in which players are given grades for their performance. For a system that garners so much traffic in the media, their grading system is quite simple. From their website, “Each player is given a grade of -2 to +2 in 0.5 increments on a given play with 0 generally being the average or ‘expected’ grade.” As analysts in a field where concrete details are the foundation of our analyses, we recognize the importance of introducing a subjective lens when it comes to analyzing human performance. Our goal is to develop a system that can accurately and fairly apply weight to different situations based on a player's efficiency in various aspects of the game. 

Through this project, we aim to take this grading system to the next level by incorporating additional data and data science techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of a player's performance. By building upon PFF's system and introducing more sophisticated methods, we hope to develop a more nuanced and accurate system that can provide valuable insights for players, coaches, and analysts alike. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the ongoing conversation about how best to evaluate and assess the performance of NFL players.
